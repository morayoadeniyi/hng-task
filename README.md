# Discoverio 

Turning your banking app into a smart financial partner that reveals the features you didn't know you needed

## What It Does

Discoverio is an intelligent discovery system that lives inside Nigerian banking apps and helps users find powerful financial tools they already have access to but don't know exist. Instead of letting useful features like automated savings, spending analytics, and budget tracking stay hidden in forgotten menus, Discoverio surfaces them at exactly the right moment through smart, contextual prompts.

Think of it as a personal banking guide that watches your financial behavior and gently nudges you toward features that can actually help you save money, track expenses, and manage your finances better.

## Why It Matters

Nigerian banks like GTBank, Access Bank, FirstBank, and Zenith have built amazing features—spending analytics, automated savings plans (EaziSave, QuickSave), payment reminders, and budget tracking tools. But the problem is that most users have no idea these features exist.

Research shows that:
- 60% of Nigerian banking app users are unaware of existing digital payment features
- Analysis of 37,460 reviews across 22 Nigerian banking apps revealed widespread complaints about lack of feature awareness
- These features are buried in non-intuitive menus and poorly promoted during onboarding

This results in people struggling with basic financial management,tracking expenses, saving consistently, and managing subscriptions, while the solutions sit unused in their banking apps. Discoverio solves this by making feature discovery smart, timely, and effortless.

## Who It Is For

- Nigerian banking app users who want better control over their finances but don't know where to start
- Young professionals receiving salaries who need help building savings habits
- Families managing rent cycles, school fees, and remittances
- Anyone who ever thought "I wish my bank could help me save more" (spoiler: it probably can!)
- Bank product managers looking to increase adoption of existing features without building new ones

## Key Features

Smart Contextual Prompts- Get feature suggestions at the exact moment you need them, not during boring onboarding tutorials

Behavioral Intelligence- The system learns from your transaction patterns (salary deposits, rent cycles, repeated transfers) and recommends relevant existing features

Built around real Nigerian financial behaviors like family remittances, data purchases, and generator fuel expenses

Zero New Features Required- Works entirely with existing banking capabilities like GTBank's Spend Analysis, Access Bank's QuickSave, FirstBank's FirstMonie tracking

Privacy-Focused- Uses only existing transaction logs and app navigation data—no new data collection needed

Admin Dashboard- Banks can track feature adoption rates, identify awareness gaps, and measure which triggers drive the most engagement

## How It Works

Example Scenarios:

1. After Salary Deposit:
   -"You just received ₦150,000. Would you like to automatically save 10% using QuickSave?"

2. Multiple Manual Transfers:
   -"You've sent money to the same person 3 times this month. Set up a standing order to save time?"

3. High Spending Week:
   -"You've spent ₦45,000 this week. Want to see where your money went with Spend Analysis?"

4. Subscription Payment:
   -"This ₦5,000 charge happens monthly. Would you like reminders before future payments?"

5. Frequent Balance Checks:
   -"You've checked your balance 8 times today. Try Budget Tracker to see your spending in real-time."

## Technologies Used

Frontend:
- React Native - For seamless integration into existing mobile banking apps
- TypeScript - Type-safe code for banking-grade reliability

Backend:
- Node.js + Express - Fast API for real-time trigger processing
- Python - For behavioral pattern analysis and machine learning models

Database:
- PostgreSQL - Secure storage for feature metadata and trigger rules
- Redis - Fast caching for real-time user behavior tracking

Analytics & Intelligence:
- TensorFlow - Machine learning models for behavioral pattern recognition

## Core Principles

No New Features- Leverages existing banking capabilities  
No New Data Collection- Uses only existing transaction logs and navigation patterns  
One-Time Setup- Catalog current app features once, benefit forever  
Contextual, Not Intrusive- Prompts appear when needed, not randomly  
Culturally Relevant- Designed for real Nigerian financial behaviors

## The Problem Being Solved

Nigerian banking apps are packed with useful features, but they're hidden treasures that users never find. It’s like having a tool full of features, but only using one because you don’t know what the rest can do. Discoverio turns these hidden treasures into discovered tools—automatically, intelligently, and at exactly the right time.

## Impact Potential

For Users: Better financial habits, increased savings, reduced stress
For Banks: Higher feature adoption without building new products, improved customer satisfaction, and reduced support tickets
For Nigeria: A more financially literate population using tools they already have access to


Built with ❤️ for Nigerian banking users who deserve to know what their apps can really do.
